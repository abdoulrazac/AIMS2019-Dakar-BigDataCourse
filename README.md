# Big Data Analytics with Python

The material in this repository was presented at a training workshop in **Dakar, Senegal** on *July 1 to July 5, 2019*. The training was organized by **The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)**.

# Course Outline and Goals
The goal of the course is to introduce participants to the use of Python to perfom data science tasks such as data ingestion, data analysis and machine learning with focus on processing of large scale datasets. This course is different from regular online courses as it uses real life datasets and case studies to challenge participants with real world data science problems, instead of solving toy problems. The structure of the course is as follows:

- **Day 1**: Introduction to Python
- **Day 2**: Python for Data Science
- **Day 3**: Big Data Processign with Pyspark
- **Day 4**: Machine Learning in Python
- **Day 5**: Big Data and ML Case Studies

# Repository Setup
The materials are organised into folders by day. All the code live in the *src* folder. Due to large size of powerpoint files, these are not included int the repository. Also, some datasets arent included in the repository. All the code use **Python 3**.
